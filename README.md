# Etrade-Project1
// Using Etrade Api to probably follow performance over time of a portfolio of S&P 500 stocks.

//Don't get mad get Etrade. We love it...

//Also maybe going to think of some ways to value stocks in terms of historic pricing....maybe correlation with some
//of the methods in common practice...90 day average, more highs and lows over a given period....maybe in
//correlation to the market as a whole, or other stocks in that given market....

//Just using this repository mainly to hack on the Etrade Api etc...probably using Python...at least at first
